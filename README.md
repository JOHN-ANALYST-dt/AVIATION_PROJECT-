<center><h1>Mitigating Critical Risks in New Aviation Ventures</h1></center>
<center><h3>1:Project Goals-</h3></center>
This project analyzes the Kind of Aircraft Makes and model with relation to the purpose of flights and the number of engines. This shows case the fuel consumptions and the budget allocation to each make. Also, we are able to see from timelines the make type and the number of engines involved in historic Accidents.
In weather forecasting 70 % of the flights were not affected with more than 2 engines
Globally, 90% of Aviation industries uses one common of engine type of aircraft
<center><h3>2:Methodology</h3></center>
Some of the analytical means used are through the correlation of the variables
Drawing of the trend lines to tell us the next expectations
Plotting of the bar graphs to the relationships and geographical mappings
<center><h3>3:Key Outcomes</h3></center>
Aircrafts with the lowest number of engines were highly affected by weather and the number of fatal accidents were very high
Aircraft with more than one engine were highly used
